## General 

What you should learn from this project:

* What is a process
* How to find a process PID
* How to kill a process
* What is a signal
* What are the 2 signals that cannot be ignored

******************************************************************************
## Tasks

### [0. What is my PID](./0-what-is-my-pid)
* Write a Bash script that displays its own PID.


### [1. List your processes](./1-list_your_processes)
* Write a Bash script that displays a list of currently running processes.


### [2. Show your Bash PID](./2-show_your_bash_pid)
* Using your previous exercise command, write a Bash script that displays lines containing the bash word, thus allowing you to easily get the PID of your Bash process.


### [3. Show your Bash PID made easy](./3-show_your_bash_pid_made_easy)
* Write a Bash script that displays the PID, along with the process name, of processes whose name contain the word bash.


### [4. To infinity and beyond](./4-to_infinity_and_beyond)
* Write a Bash script that displays To infinity and beyond indefinitely. 


### [5. Kill me now](./5-kill_me_now)

### [6. Kill me now made easy](./6-kill_me_now_made_easy)
* Write a Bash script that kills 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process.


### [7. Highlander](./7-highlander)
