### [1. Types of network](./1-types_of_network)
* 


### [2. MAC and IP address](./2-MAC_and_IP_address)
* 


### [3. UDP and TCP](./3-UDP_and_TCP)
* 


### [4. TCP and UDP ports](./4-TCP_and_UDP_ports)
* Once packets have been sent to the right network device using IP using either UDP or TCP as a mode of transportation, it needs to actually enter the network device.
